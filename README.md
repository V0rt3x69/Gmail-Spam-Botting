Hi this is a quick script that I made for spam botting google accounts in python.

How to use the script (WINDOWS ONLY):

1. Download the latest version of python
2. Read the 'Read First' file
3. After reading the 'Read First' file go back, click on the green code button and click download zip
4. Extract the file
5. Go in the file and click on where it says 'This PC > Downloads > Google Bot'
6. after clicking on it, it should turn blue then write 'cmd'
7. After the command prompt openes write 'python main.py' in that exact way
8. After writing that follow the instructions and enjoy!
